#INTRODUCTION

A simple shell project created by JEREMIAH and HAFSORH. The simple shell is a collaborative project, the project is to create a shell that mimics the bash shell.
The shell project was written with C programming language, it was complied with the gcc complier, and it was styled and documented with Betty.

#SUMMARY

We created a shell command that prompt the user to type a command and read input of from the user. An infinite loop was included in order to prompt the user  to type in more commands and an end of file condition which allow the user to exit the shell.
The user input was parsed and tokenized (Split the command). The user input and out was handled and managed using the fork and execve function.
